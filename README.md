# NBLAST figures
This repository contains the [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) documents used to make the figure panels for [Costa et al. (2014) NBLAST: Rapid, sensitive comparison of neuronal structure and construction of neuron family databases](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/006346).

We recommend the use of [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com) for building the documents. It is first necessary to install some R packages, which can be done by sourcing the ``R/InstallPackages.R`` script. After this, simply open one of the ``.Rmd`` files and click the 'Knit HTML' button to begin. When this process has finished, a web page containing text and images will be produced.
